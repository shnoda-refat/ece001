   <h3>Dis Advantages:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>The machines have no moral emotions and values. They perform what is programmed and they cannot judge right or wrong. So decisions cannot be made if they encounter an unfamiliar situation. Either it performs incorrectly or collapses in such cases
     <li>High cost, the creation of artificial intelligence requires huge costs because it is very complex machines. Expensive repair and maintenance costs
     <li>It does not improve with good things, unlike humans, artificial intelligence cannot be improved by experiment. It stores a lot of data but the way to access and use it is completely different from human intelligence
     <li>Non-original creativity: Humans are highly sensitive and emotional intellectuals. They see, hear, think and feel. Their thoughts are guided by feelings that machines completely lack. The intuitive potential of the human brain cannot be repeated
